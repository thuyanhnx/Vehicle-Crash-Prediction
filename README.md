# Frequency and Severity of Vehicle Crash Prediction using Statistical Models

The project aims to investigate the contributing factors associated with vehicle crashes. We focus on two core research questions: predict the frequency of crashes, enabling proactive identification of high-risk factors. Secondly, we will predict the severity of crashes, which is crucial for optimizing emergency response and safety precautions.
