# Frequency and Severity of Vehicle Crash Prediction using Statistical Models

The project aims to investigate the contributing factors associated with vehicle crashes by focusing on two core research questions: predicting the frequency of crashes (enabling proactive identification of high-risk factors), and predicting the severity of crashes (optimizing emergency response and safety precautions).
